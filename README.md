## Description
This project is the api for a social media network such as twitter where users can make profiles, add friends, write thoughts, add reactions to thoughts, and delete said users, thoughts, and reactions. The project is only in the development stage, without a front end as this projects focus was on learning to utilize MongoDB for a database.

## Installation
To install the project first clone the repository using "git clone" https://github.com/Noah-Wyche/Social-Network-API. You will need Node downloaded onto your machine as well as MongoDB Compass. Install the project dependencies, and once everything is in place, run "npm start" to begin the application from the root directory.

## Usage
To fully take advantage of the technology being implimented we would need to build some sort of functional front end to querry the database and perform the operations in a visual way. Currently however using the application takes the form of querrying the database through a service like insomnia. There we can perform crud opereations following the api routes to interact with the database in all the ways we described earlier.
